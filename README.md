I just wanted to share with you that I've recently expanded my knowledge on using APIs and learned how to use the JS Leaflet library to create map components. It was really cool to learn about! 🌍

The tools I used for this project were SCSS, ReactJS, and Leaflet library. My name is Marvellous Obatale and if you're interested, you can check out my Frontend Mentor profile at https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/MARVELGARR and my GitHub profile at https://github.com/MARVELGARR. 🤓

I used a mobile-first workflow for this project and it was a lot of fun to work on. If you want to connect with me, you can find me on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MARVEL_GARRA. 😎
